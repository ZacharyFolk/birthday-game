# Birthday game

The boy is becoming a teenager and this is a silly puzzle game to help him find his presents and teach myself more about ES6.  

Code was shamelesly hacked up from this brilliant little project :

Such a cool pattern that makes use of dynamic imports and creates an easy way to execute commands.  
With this clean structure it is really fun and easy to add new modules that can be run anytime.

This version is very specific for my kid so it wont even make sense but I am starting to host here and will continue to play with the code.

I am hosting a current version for at least this year if any curious soul wanted to play aound with it.. https://teenomatron.lol/
